libcapseo:
    * add support of ogg (and/or maybe mkv) as container format
    * add support to include audio into the stream(?)

cpsrecode:
    * fail if output _filename_ already exists
    * complete progress bar (ETA, progresss percentage)

general:
    * instead of cpsplay, write a libavformat/mplayer plugin for supporting capseo codec 
      streams to play or be used by mencoder.
